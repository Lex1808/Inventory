Maintaining a Parts Database
This program is designed to practice using nested arrays and structures in C.
To illustrate how nested arrays and structures are used in practice, we will develop a rather long program that maintains a database of parts stored in a warehouse. 
The program is built on the basis of an array of structures, each of which contains information about one part - its number, name, and quantity. 
The program supports the following operations:

- Add a new part number, part name, and initial quantity in the warehouse.
  The program should display an error message if the part already exists in the database or if the database is full.
  Print the part name and the current stock quantity by the part number.
  The program should print an error message if the part number is not in the database.

- Change the stock quantity by the specified part number. The program should print an error message if the part number is not in the database.

- Print a table with all the information contained in the database. The parts should be displayed in the order in which they were entered.

- End the program execution.
